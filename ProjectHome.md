If properly embedded, this script will fix any cross platform and/or cross browser issues. Documentation coming soon.

Be sure to check the source http://code.google.com/p/pleasework/source/browse/


There is no release yet, but the project is moving steadily and there already is flash support for iPad, as well as the scripts that emulate target browser on any other browser.

## Roadmap ##

The current codebase is quite stable and we would like to keep it that way.
It does not mean that there won't be any new enhancements. On the opposite - the scripts to convert 1D and 2D apps into 3D are almost there yet. Keep your visors tuned!
